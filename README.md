# Global Energy Consumption and CO2 Emissions Dataset
### Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive dataset that tracks the environmental consequences of industrialization and economic growth, with a particular focus on CO2 emissions. As the world continues to advance and modernize, the impact of these emissions on global climate change becomes increasingly critical. This dataset, sourced from the US Energy Administration, aims to illuminate the factors driving these emissions through detailed data spanning from the 1980s to 2020.

### Objective
The main objective of this dataset is to help researchers, policymakers, and the public understand the significant factors that contribute to global climate change and to foster strategies that mitigate environmental impact while supporting sustainable growth.

### Dataset Description
The dataset offers an in-depth look at the energy production and consumption patterns of various countries alongside critical economic indicators such as GDP and population. This analysis provides insights into the relationships between energy use, economic development, and environmental impact on a global scale.

### Feature Descriptions

Country: The country in question.

Energy_type: The type of energy source.

Year: The year the data was recorded.

Energy_consumption: The amount of energy consumption for the specific energy source, measured in quad Btu.

Energy_production: The amount of energy production for the specific energy source, measured in quad Btu.

GDP: The country's GDP at purchasing power parities, measured in billion 2015 PPP.

Population: The population of the specific country, measured in millions of people (Mperson).

Energy_intensity_per_capita: A measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy, calculated as units of energy per capita, measured in MMBtu/person.

Energy_intensity_by_GDP: A measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy, calculated as units of energy per unit of GDP, measured in 1000 Btu/2015$ GDP PPP.

CO2_emission: The amount of CO2 emitted, measured in million tonnes of CO2 (MMtonnes CO2).

### Conclusion

The analysis of global energy consumption and CO2 emissions highlights a critical intersection between economic growth, population size, and environmental sustainability. The largest energy consumers—China, the United States, and India—are also major contributors to global CO2 emissions, driven by expansive industrial activities and energy-intensive technologies. This emphasizes the need for aggressive policy interventions and international cooperation to mitigate environmental impacts. Economic growth, rather than population size alone, is a strong predictor of CO2 emissions, suggesting that targeting energy efficiency and the adoption of sustainable energy technologies may be crucial. Without a significant shift towards cleaner energy and more efficient energy use, global efforts to combat climate change will continue to face substantial obstacles.
